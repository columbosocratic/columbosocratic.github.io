# *esse situs* : an analysis of situational agency

This blog has been made to develop the `situational' approach to agency.

The conceptual influences of this theory is to be found in Heidegger, Wittgenstein and others (UPDATING). Though no effort is made to respect the bounds or necessities of these authors theories.

This theory (of situational agency) is still in development, and this blog's cataloguing of its parts will include much acknowledged or unacknowledged speculation.

We hope that the further development of this blog will go some ways to developing this theory.

### Anticipation

Anticipation is the
>anticipation of (the qualia of) exercising a capacity $$c$$ in a given situation $$S$$.

*Self-critical*: Is this leaning too heavily on self-knowledge of **dopimanergic** anticipation?

*Retort to Self-critical*: Even religious anticipation, which is the anticipation of a total transformation of existence, has in mind the exercise of the *trivial capacity (being-in)* in the situation of *"freedom"* : the situation affording maximally the basic capacities defining the agent. Note that "freedom" is a situation whose purely formal existence is guaranteed by 'antinomy'.
  * New concept: "trivial capacity" - we equip every situation with a trivial capacity of being-in. This is the capacity merely to be in the situation. This capacity need not have fidelity $$1$$. Consider a situation which cannot be kept up or maintained by the agent, in this case the situation will end almost surely and so the capacity of `merely' being-in will be obstructed. What is interesting with this example is that it shows the plurality of ways of encoding a present situation by an agent. The same agent who considers themselves in a fixed situation which they are losing their grip on, may alternatively consider themselves in a situation of flux which they have perfect access to being-in in (fidelity $$1$$ capacity).

#### and qualia

Is the faculty of anticipation the key to the theorising of qualia?

Heidegger ~ We are mad because we are always out ahead of ourselves (in possibile ways to be)

'We are mad' to be mean, we think non-dual thoughts.

## Relevances

### What are relevances?

#### as reified objections

Recall that a reified objection is an object. An object requires a source of presence and this presence is here derived as an externalisation of the presence frustrated by an objection of type obstruction - further analysis required for objection of type absence (when we talk about 'holes' this seems second-order). Reification [of an objection $$o$$] depends on the fidelity of the second-order capacity to induce $$o$$. That is, this fidelity $f$ must be greater than some threshold $t$, which may depend on the situation, or may be global. 

Partial reification may refer to a lower threshold $t'$ - although perhaps we were always dealing with a continuum anyway. (FIX PREVIOUS)

##### A quick sanity check on what we usually mean by 'objects'
>Objects are distinguished in experience by an apparent self-sufficiency. Precisely for this reason the minds seeks these objects 'in themselves', their essence. It is as if these objects where drawing up their local situation into themselves, attempting to wrap themselves in it. The end result of which self-containing is a vision of the object floating antinom-ally in Platonic abyss.
